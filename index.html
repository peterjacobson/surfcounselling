        <li>Learning ability and cognitive function is primed and enhanced by physical activity</li>
        <li>A natural increase in self- esteem and wellbeing comes with the trial and error and development of new skills in the water</li>
        <li>The physical/psychological effects from the surf training provide a grounded more open platform for the counselling work</li>
        <li>Trust is developed through the relationship forged in the water</li>

      <h2>Research</h2>
      <i class="fa fa-plus fa-2x"></i>
    </div>
    <div class="collapsable collapsed">
      <p>Research points to the disconnect, or lack of grounding for many in the modern world. This hugely effects our resilience, stress management and mental and physical health.</p>
      <p>Young people are particularly affected because often they are divorced from nature, activities outside and a connection with this which gives confidence and a learned release place for negative thoughts and emotions. A place where balance can be restored.</p>
      <p>Exercising in nature raises serotonin levels, triggers primal regions of our brain and psyche, provides more sensory stimulation than indoor activities, increases feelings of wellbeing, lowers depression, and sun exposure increases vitamin D levels and helps optimise hormones.</p>
      <p>Coupled with this large amounts of negative ions are released when waves break, these are charged particles which energize us. Dimethyl sulphide is also released by saltwater which improves sleep. Seawater contains many minerals which help heal and detoxify the body.</p>
      <p>Brain research indicates learning a new sport stimulates brain growth, which for young men in adolescence is particularly important as there is a shutdown in the emotional brain while the frontal cortex is being developed taking large amounts of energy to grow a new matrix for adulthood.</p>
      <p>“Strong evidence supports the connection between movement and learning. Evidence from imaging sources, anatomical studies, and clinical data shows that moderate exercise enhances cognitive processing. It also increases the number of brain cells.” From Teaching with the Brain in Mind” by Eric Jensen.</p>

    <div class="collapsable collapsed">
      <p>I am a member of The New Zealand Counsellors Association with a Bachelor of Counselling and Certificate in Social Work. I have counselled a wide spectrum of clients since 2006 with a most recent emphasis on young men and adolescents.</p>
      <p>Before qualifying as a counsellor I have had a multitude of “careers” and a wide life experience which allows my counselling to be heartfelt and real as well as fully informed by my training.</p>
      <p>I have successfully helped many young men step into different more useful life patterns.</p>

      <i class="fa fa-plus fa-2x"></i>
    </div>
    <div class="collapsable collapsed">
      <p>The main modalities/therapies I will be working with will be Focusing Therapy, Mindfulness practice, RAIN (Recognize, Accept, Investigate, Non-identification) and Narrative Therapy.  Within this framework I will assess each client’s natural inclined way to work rather than imposing a systemic structure on to everybody I work with.</p>

    <div class="collapsable collapsed">
      <p>I am first aid trained, a strong swimmer and will always assess surf conditions and pull the lesson if there is any element of danger to the learning client.</p>
      <p>The trainees must be able to swim unaided a minimum of 50 metres.</p>

      <h2>How it Works</h2>
      <i class="fa fa-plus fa-2x"></i>
    </div>
    <div class="collapsable collapsed">
      <p>Both the surf lessons and the counselling will be one to one on the same day. It will be the client’s call whether the surf or the counselling comes first but my preference is for the surfing to come before the counselling as much as possible.  We will surf at either Lyall Bay or Titahi Bay beaches with transport provided to Titahi Bay if Lyall Bay is un surfable. Lessons will be cancelled if either the surf is too dangerous or too small.</p>
      <p>An appraisal will be provided at the end of the work. Further counselling can be negotiated at the end of the program, for some this will be necessary, 6 sessions are, for some clients really a beginning or mid- point in their learning.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="collapsable collapsed">
      <p>The ability to surf, which is an avenue for life-long fun, grounding, physical and emotional release and self-confidence.</p>
      <p>Surfing supports the mental skills developed through the counselling sessions, which provide reliable tools for optimising wellbeing and dealing with issues as they arise.</p>
